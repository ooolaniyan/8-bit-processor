Custom 8-bit 5 Stage Pipeline Processor

8-Bit 5-Stage Pipelined RISC-Style Processor with Hazard Handling

The processor features a 5-stage pipeline with a  custom RISC style 14-bit instruction set architecture (ISA) with 16 instructions, and comprehensive hazard management including flushing for control hazards and forwarding/stalling for data hazards. This processor was designed using Verilog and implemented on a Basys 3 FPGA board. 

Features:
5-stage pipelining (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Writeback).
8-bit data path.
14-bit custom RISC style ISA (16 instructions).
4 General Purpose Registers(GPRs).
Control hazard handling (flushes, jumps and branches).
Data hazard handling (forwarding, stall, custom path). 
Instruction cycle counter on 7-seg display
